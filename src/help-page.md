# How do I get my Data?

To use this website, you'll need to download your Spotify listening history. Here's how you can get it:

1. **Go to [Spotify's Privacy Data Request Page](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/)**:
   - Sign in with your Spotify account.
   - Scroll all the way down the page.
   - Request your data by following the instructions on the page.
      - Make sure **Account Data** is selected and click request data at the bottom of the page.
      - You will then have to confirm this action through an email sent to you by Spotify.

2. **Wait for the Data**:
   - It may take about 5 days for Spotify to process your request.
   - Once ready, you’ll receive an email with a download link.

3. **Download and Upload**:
   - Download the ZIP file from the email. (You do not need to do anything to this file at all—leave it as is.)
   - Once you have the file, come back to this website and upload the ZIP file directly into the uploader section.

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Your Data
   - After uploading your Spotify data, the system will process your file and generate three outputs:
      - A **Cumulative Bar Chart Race** that visualizes how your top songs change over the course of a year.
      - A **Sunburst Diagram** that breaks down your listening history by genre and artist.
      - An upcoming **Third Visualization** that will explore your data in a new way (under development).

### 2. Visualize Your Data
   - **Cumulative Bar Chart Race**: Watch how your top songs and playtimes evolve over time. This dynamic chart tracks the rise and fall of your most listened-to songs, showing trends across your listening history.
   
   - **Sunburst Diagram**: Explore your music preferences by genre and artist, scaled based on listening time.
      - Click on specific genres or artists to select them.
      - Once you've made your selections, click the **Get Recommendations** button.
      - The system will use the Spotify API to generate song recommendations based on the genres and artists you selected.
   
   - **[Third Visualization]**: A new interactive chart is in development to further enhance your understanding of your listening data.

### 3. Have Fun
   - This was a fun project to work on, and I hope you enjoy exploring your data!
