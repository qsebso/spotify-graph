# How do I get my Data?

To use this website, you'll need to download your Spotify listening history. Here's how you can get it:

1. **Go to [Spotify's Privacy Data Request Page](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/)**:
   - Sign in with your Spotify account.
   - Scroll all the way down the page.
   - Request your data by following the instructions on the page.
      - Make sure **Account Data** is selected and click request data at the bottom of the page.
      - You will then have to confirm this action through an email sent to you by Spotify.

2. **Wait for the Data**:
   - It may take about 5 days for Spotify to process your request.
   - Once ready, you’ll receive an email with a download link.

3. **Download and Upload**:
   - Download the ZIP file from the email. (You do not need to do anything to this file at all—leave it as is.)
   - Once you have the file, come back to this website and upload the ZIP file directly into the uploader section.

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Your Data
   - After uploading your Spotify data, the system will process your file and generate four outputs:
      - A **Cumulative Bar Chart Race** that visualizes how your top songs change over the course of a year.
      - A **Sunburst Diagram** that breaks down your listening history by genre and artist.
      - A **Top 10 Weekly Bar Chart** that highlights your top 10 songs every week.
      - An interactive **Spotify Wrapped**-style analysis, which showcases personalized insights about your listening habits.

### 2. Visualize Your Data
   - **Cumulative Bar Chart Race**: Watch how your top songs and playtimes evolve over time. This dynamic chart tracks the rise and fall of your most listened-to songs, showing trends across your listening history.

   - **Sunburst Diagram**: Explore your music preferences by genre and artist, scaled based on listening time.
      - Click on specific genres or artists to select them.
      - Once you've made your selections, click the **Get Recommendations** button.
      - The system will use the Spotify API to generate song recommendations based on the genres and artists you selected.
   
   - **Top 10 Weekly Bar Chart**: Visualize how your top 10 songs change week by week. This chart helps you track shifts in your favorite songs and their ranking throughout the year, offering insight into your evolving musical tastes.

   - **Spotify Wrapped**: Dive into an in-depth summary of your listening habits. This section showcases your top artists, tracks, genres, listening streaks, and more, giving you a comprehensive overview of your music journey throughout the year.

### 3. Have Fun
   - This was a fun project to work on, and I hope you enjoy exploring your data!
